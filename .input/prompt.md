# Tasks 🧑‍💻

- **Create a new Power BI Project (PBIP)** for the `Fabrikam Electronic` company that answer the requirements in document `requirements.md`.
- **Strictly follow the development guidelines in `.kb/powerbi-pbip-kb.md`** (Be sure to review any referenced KB documents included in this document).
- **Don't implement the project directly!** Start with a good technical **development spec** document with name `dev-spec.md` for my review.
- **All source code and created documents should go to the `src/` folder**. Do not work outside of that folder.
