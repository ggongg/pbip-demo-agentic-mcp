# Detailed Tasks 

You are working in a PBIP repository for the FABCON demo. 

## Phase 2 — Atlanta FabCon Planning Report (Scenarios 5–8)
- Use the **Atlanta_Attractions_Data.xlsx** dataset from the `.input/` folder and any existing semantic model built on top of it.
- Create or update the Power BI Project (PBIP): Build out the **Atlanta | FabCon Planning** report so that it satisfies the requirements in `requirements.md` (Part B) and the report layout guidelines in `.kb/template-report-kb.md`.
- **Do not bypass the spec step:** for each reporting scenario (5–8), update or extend `dev-spec.md` The spec should:
  - Summarize current model state.
  - List proposed tables, relationships, measures, and DAX.
  - Map each proposal to a requirement ID from `requirements.md`.

## General Rules

- **All source files and created documents must stay under `src/` folder.**  Do not create content or work outside that folder.
- Always respect the knowledge base files in `.kb/`:
  - `.kb/powerbi-modeling-kb.md`
  - `.kb/powerbi-pbip-kb.md`
  - `.kb/template-report-kb.md`
  - Theme files and layout PNGs
- Before making changes, explain your plan in `dev-spec.md` so I can review it
